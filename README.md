# Thoracic-EIT-Imaging-Algorithms
This MATLAB package include code and data for the execution of several difference imaging algorithms applied on dynamic thoracic imaging. It also includes quantitative metrics (Figures of Merit-FoM) and comparison between state-of-the-art approaches and the recently proposed Method-of-Moment based Sparse Bayesian Learning one.
